> If I were forming an octahedron out of 6 atoms, and each vertex could be one of four possible atomic types (Ta, Hf, Ti, and Zr).  Each permutation of the octahedron can consist of 1 or more atoms, so a homogenous octahedron is permissible. How many unique combinations are there for selecting vertex atom types? Note that symmetric cases are considered degenerate and should not be double-counted.

##### GPT4's response (that there are 187 unique combinations)

To determine the number of unique atomic configurations for an octahedron, we will use [Burnside's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma), which states that the number of distinct orbits (unique configurations) of a group action on a set can be found by averaging the number of fixed points of each element in the group. First, let's identify the symmetry group for an octahedron and then count the fixed points for each symmetry operation.

The octahedron has 24 symmetries, which can be divided into 5 conjugacy classes:

1. Identity (1 element): Leave the octahedron unchanged.
2. Rotation by 180 degrees about an axis through a pair of opposite vertices (3 elements).
3. Rotation by 120 degrees and 240 degrees about an axis through the center of opposite edges (8 elements).
4. Rotation by 90 degrees and 270 degrees about an axis through the center of opposite faces (6 elements).
5. Reflection through a plane that bisects the octahedron through opposite vertices (6 elements).

Now, let's count the fixed points of each symmetry operation for each of the 4 atomic types (Ta, Hf, Ti, and Zr):

1. Identity: All 4^6 = **4,096 possible configurations** are fixed points.
  Example: Ta-Ta-Hf-Hf-Ti-Ti

2. Rotation by 180 degrees: There are 3 axes of rotation, one through each pair of opposite vertices. For each axis, there are 4 pairs with the same atomic type (Ta-Ta, Hf-Hf, Ti-Ti, and Zr-Zr) and 6 distinct pairs with different atomic types (Ta-Hf, Ta-Ti, Ta-Zr, Hf-Ti, Hf-Zr, Ti-Zr). Since the distinct pairs are overcounted by a factor of 2, we need to divide the number of distinct pairs by 2. Thus, there are 4 + (6 / 2) = 4 + 3 = 7 fixed points for each axis of rotation, resulting in a total of **3 * 7 = 21 fixed points for the 180-degree rotations**.
Example: Ta-Hf-Ta-Hf-Ta-Hf (180-degree rotation around the axis through opposite Hf atoms)
3. Rotation by 120 and 240 degrees: No configurations are fixed points, as each vertex would have to be the same atom, but that is already counted as a fixed point under the identity operation.
4. Rotation by 90 and 270 degrees: No configurations are fixed points for the same reason as rotation by 120 and 240 degrees.
5. Reflection: There are 6 reflection planes, one for each pair of opposite vertices. For each reflection plane, there are three pairs of opposite vertices that must have the same atomic type. For each pair, there are 4 possibilities: Ta-Ta, Hf-Hf, Ti-Ti, and Zr-Zr. Since there are 3 pairs of opposite vertices, we have 4 * 4 * 4 = 4^3 = 64 possible fixed configurations for each reflection plane. As there are 6 reflection planes, the **total number of fixed points for the reflection is 6 * 64 = 384**.
  Example: Ta-Ta-Hf-Hf-Ti-Ti (reflection plane through the midpoints of the edges connecting Ta-Ta, Hf-Hf, and Ti-Ti pairs)

Now, let's calculate the number of unique combinations using Burnside's lemma:

(1 * 4,096 + 3 * 7 + 8 * 0 + 6 * 0 + 6 * 64) / 24 = (4,096 + 21 + 0 + 0 + 384) / 24 = **4,501 / 24 = 187.54**.

Since the number of unique combinations must be an integer, we can round down to the nearest integer, **resulting in 187 unique combinations for selecting vertex atom types for the octahedron**.
